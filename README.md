# Node.js Express Backend with MongoDB

## Overview

This backend server provides the foundation for application's server-side logic, handling user authentication, data validation, file uploads, and more. Below the information on setting up, running, and extending this backend.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: The backend is built using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment.

- **Express**: Express is used as the web application framework to handle HTTP requests, routing, and middleware.

- **Validator**: Validator is used to perform data validation and sanitization of incoming data.

- **MongoDB/Mongoose**: MongoDB is the NoSQL database used for data storage, and Mongoose is an ODM (Object-Document Mapping) library for Node.js and MongoDB.

- **JSON Web Token (JWT)**: JWT is used for user authentication and authorization.

- **Multer**: Multer is a middleware used for handling file uploads.

- **Bcrypt**: Bcrypt is used for hashing and securing user passwords.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and authenticate themselves using JWT.

- **Data Validation**: Data sent to the server is validated and sanitized to ensure data integrity.

- **File Uploads**: Multer is used to handle file uploads, making it easy to upload and manage files.

- **Password Security**: User passwords are securely hashed using Bcrypt before being stored in the database.

- **Routes**: The backend includes routes for user authentication, data manipulation, and more. These can be extended to add more features to your application.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required Node.js modules using `npm install` or `yarn install`.

3. Set up a MongoDB database and update the database connection configuration in the appropriate file (e.g., `config/database.js`).

4. Create a `.env` file to store sensitive information such as JWT secrets and API keys.

5. Start the backend server using `npm run start:dev` or `yarn start`.

6. Your backend server will be running at a specified port (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
